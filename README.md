Website update

Im updating the flomo notio website to make it more user friendly and attractive. 
I belive having a dynamic and animated site is best for my business model. 

I'm yet to create a portfolio page and pricing packages page.

Homepage is what you see here and it's pretty much complete. Maybe few tweaks can be done here and there to make it more interesting. 
like color changes and text changes (witty or casual style maybe).
